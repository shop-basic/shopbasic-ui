# Shop Basic



[Shop Basic](https://coreui.io/angular)  




#### <i>Prerequisites</i>
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.jsÂ®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js
Angular 14 requires `Node.js` version `^14.15` or `^16.10`.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI
Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```
## What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:



## Documentation

The documentation for the CoreUI Admin Template is hosted at our website [CoreUI for Angular](https://coreui.io/angular/)

---

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, CoreUI Free Admin Template is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).

See [the Releases section of our project](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template/releases) for changelogs for each release version.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
